Data Cleaning for Machine Learning

Overview

This project compares a fixed (manual) and an adaptive (performance-driven) data cleaning pipeline to evaluate their impact on machine learning model performance.
The same dataset, model, and simulated data imperfections are used to ensure a fair comparison.

Project Structure
	run_all.py — main entry point; runs manual and adaptive pipelines and reports metrics
	data_prep.py — data loading and dirty data generation
	manual_pipeline.py — fixed cleaning pipeline
	adaptive_pipeline.py — adaptive, metric-driven cleaning strategies
	metrics_utils.py — model training and evaluation
	winequality-red.csv — dataset

Requirements
	Python 3.9+
	numpy
	pandas
	scikit-learn

How to Run

Using a virtual environment.
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux

# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows (cmd)
venv\Scripts\activate

or
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
python run_all.py

Output

The script prints:
	dataset statistics before and after cleaning
	performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)
	execution time
	best adaptive cleaning strategy based on RMSE
